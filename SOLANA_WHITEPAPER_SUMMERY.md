# Solana Whitepaper Summary

*Based on [Solana Whitepaper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf)*

## What is Solana?

Solana is a fast blockchain that solves speed problems other blockchains face. It can process about 710,000 transactions per second with current hardware.

## Main Innovations

### Proof of History (PoH)

- **What it is**: A way to prove when events happened and in what order
- **How it works**: 
  - Uses a hash function that must run in sequence
  - Each output becomes input for the next hash
  - Data gets timestamped by adding it to the sequence
  - Creates a time record everyone can trust

- **Why it matters**:
  - Everyone agrees on transaction order
  - Verification can happen on many computers at once
  - Reduces back-and-forth messages between nodes
  - Confirms transactions in less than a second
  - Solves the ordering problem without waiting for confirmations

- **The key insight**: 
  - Hash creation must be sequential (CPU-bound)
  - Hash verification can be parallelized (GPU-friendly)
  - Allows throughput limited only by hardware, not artificial timeouts

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

- **Purpose**: Fast confirmation of the PoH sequence
- **Key parts**:
  - **Bonds**: Money validators lock up as collateral
  - **Slashing**: Punishment for validators who break rules
  - **Super Majority**: When ⅔ of validators (by stake) agree

- **How voting works**:
  - Validators sign to confirm the current state
  - Need ⅔ agreement within a time limit
  - Node gets slashed if it votes for multiple states or approves fake hashes

- **Leader selection**:
  - Nodes are selected based on stake amount
  - Leader schedule changes each epoch
  - Uses random seed to prevent predictability
  - Gives all validators a fair chance based on their stake

### Leader Rotation

- **How leaders work**:
  - One node acts as Leader to create the PoH sequence
  - Leader puts transactions in order for processing
  - Processes transactions and tells other nodes the results

*Transaction flow showing:*
1. Messages sent by users to the Leader
2. Ordered output sent from Leader to replicator nodes (Verifiers)
3. Votes from Verifiers to confirm the state

- **How rotation works**:
  - Leaders change to prevent one node having too much power
  - Leader schedule determined by active validator set
  - Validator with most stake becomes leader if current one fails
  - Backup leaders ready to step in
  - Leaders can hand over control smoothly by sending a message

- **When leaders change**:
  - When fork in the sequence is found
  - When errors happen
  - When network times out
  - On schedule

### CAP Theorem Approach

![CAP](/assets/cap.png)

- **How Solana handles network splits**:
  - First focuses on Consistency over Availability
  - Uses PoH as objective time measure
  - Eventually switches to Availability after enough time

- **Recovery from network splits**:
  - Can recover from splits of any size
  - Has three different timeout modes:
    - Fast unstaking when >⅔ validators active (quick recovery)
    - Medium unstaking when between ½ and ⅔ active (wait for nodes)
    - Very slow unstaking when <½ active (prevent takeover)
  - Gives people time to choose which network part to use
  - Prevents minority forks from gaining control

### Proof of Replication (PoRep)

- **Purpose**: Prove data is stored on the network
- **How it works**:
  - Encrypts data blocks in sequence
  - Generators pick random bytes from blocks to create proofs
  - Many proofs checked at once in parallel

- **Key features**:
  - Fast checking through streaming approach
  - Keys change regularly to prevent reuse
  - Works with PoH to prevent fake records

## System Design

### Main Parts

1. **Leader**:
   - Creates the PoH sequence
   - Takes in transactions and puts them in order
   - Signs the state after processing

2. **Verifiers**:
   - Copy the blockchain state
   - Make sure data is always available
   - Check that leader is honest by redoing calculations
   - Vote on correct states

3. **Validators**:
   - Vote on the state
   - Approve storage nodes
   - Can become leaders based on schedule

### Performance Limits

- **Network**: ~710k transactions per second on a 1 Gbps connection
- **Computing**: Limited by CPU/GPU cores, up to 900k verifications per second
- **Memory**: Can handle 2.75M transactions per second with 1TB memory

### Scaling Approaches

- **Vertical Scaling**:
  - Add more powerful hardware to nodes
  - Simple to implement
  - Benefits from improving technology
  - Limited by hardware capabilities
  - Higher node requirements

- **Horizontal Scaling**:
  - Multiple PoH generators running in parallel
  - Each generator processes different transactions
  - Generators sync periodically by mixing their states
  - Provides path to unlimited scaling
  - More complex to implement

### Smart Contracts

- Uses Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) code
- Main benefits:
  - Connects to system functions with no overhead
  - Runs tasks in parallel on GPU
  - Works with standard programming tools

## What Makes Solana Different

- **No Artificial Waiting**: Doesn't wait for block confirmations
- **Scale Out**: Multiple generators can work together for more capacity
- **Security**: Protected against long-term attacks by PoH and PoRep
- **Split Handling**: Favors correct data first, then availability if split lasts
- **Recovery**: Can rebuild from any point after failure
- **Incentives**: System designed to punish bad behavior with slashing

## Bottom Line

Solana uses Proof of History, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Replication to process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. By solving the time problem in distributed systems, it works faster than older blockchains.

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite its innovative design, Solana faces several challenges:

1. **Centralization Issues**
   - High hardware requirements limit validator participation
     - Minimum recommended: 12-core/24-thread CPU, 128GB RAM, 2TB SSD
     - Estimated cost: $5,000-$8,000 for bare minimum hardware
   - Only ~1,700 validators vs Ethereum's 500,000+ validators
   - Top 20 validators control over 35% of the stake

2. **Network Reliability**
   - At least 8 major outages since mainnet launch:
     - September 14, 2021: 17-hour outage from transaction flooding (Raydium IDO)
     - December 4, 2021: Performance degradation from high compute transactions
     - January 21-22, 2022: Network congestion from bots during NFT mints
     - April 30-May 1, 2022: 7-hour outage from NFT minting bots
     - June 1, 2022: 4.5-hour outage from consensus failure
     - February 25, 2023: 20-hour degradation from version upgrade issues
     - February 6, 2024: 5-hour outage from memory issues in validator nodes
   - Each outage requires manual intervention from validators

3. **Technical Tradeoffs**
   - Complex architecture increases bug risk
   - Current maximum throughput in production: ~2,000-4,000 TPS (far below theoretical limits)
   - State bloat: Ledger growing at ~100GB per day during peak usage
   - Storage requirements growing faster than hardware improvements
   - Parallelization challenges when implementing cross-shard transactions

4. **Security Concerns**
   - Wormhole bridge hack: $320 million stolen (February 2022)
   - Mango Markets exploit: $100+ million manipulated through oracle price attack (October 2022)
   - Slope wallet compromise: Thousands of wallets drained of $4.5 million (August 2022)
   - Metaplex Candy Machine vulnerability exposed NFT projects
   - Vulnerability in Sealevel (Solana VM) allowed data injections in 2022

5. **Development Challenges**
   - Error handling often unclear with generic "Transaction failed" messages
   - Documentation gaps for complex operations
   - Breaking changes in runtime versions requiring coordinated validator upgrades
   - Priority fee market can lead to transaction starvation for regular users
   - Rust-only smart contract development limits developer pool

Solana's design prioritizes performance over maximum decentralization, offering different tradeoffs than other blockchains. While it achieves high transaction throughput and low fees, users should understand these limitations.
